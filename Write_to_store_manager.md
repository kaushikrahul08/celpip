Dear Manager,

The purpose of my writing today is to inform you about my disappointment in the recent visit to your store. 
To begin with, I recently received an advertisement about the opening of a new store. The advertisement highlighted many 
low prices on a wide range of items. Therefore, this advertisement enticed me to visit to your store.

However, upon my arrival. I was unable to find any of the items that were prominently advertised in the flyer. 
This was not only frustrating but also left me feeling misled and disappointed; I was truly looking forward to 
shopping a list of much-needed items.

In order to address this issue, I would like to suggest a few steps. First,  focus on better management of your store inventory. 
Furthermore, to avoid such issues, you should validate the stock and make clear communication to the customer. 
I believe implementing these measures not only will improve the customer shopping experience. Also, it will help rebuild customer trust.

I hope you will consider my advice for your account and I look forward to seeing positive changes in the store's operations.

Yours sincerely,
Rahul Sharma
