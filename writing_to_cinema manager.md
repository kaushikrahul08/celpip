# write a email to cinema manager for a bad exp. 

Dear Manager,

The purpose of my writing today is to inform you about an unfortunate incident that occurred with me on the premises of the Cineplex cinema.

To begin with, I visited the theatre on 10th July and bought a ticket for the movie called Ultimatum, to have a pleasant and cheerful time; Unfortunately, my enjoyment was greatly obstructed 
by a group of teenagers, who were sitting next to me. Initially, they were playing music on their phones and talking loudly with each other. 
I warned them multiple times, that their behaviour is deplorable, and I will complain to the movie staff about their unprovoked attitude.

However, to my utter astonishment, they kept repeating harassment episodes even after multiple exhortations. Finally, I decided to call the theatre staff and explain to them the background of the incident; 
the auditorium manager tried to make the group understand but, the situation did not improve.

Given the aforementioned scenario, I would like to give a few suggestions to overcome these situations. Firstly, create a strict code of conduct about misbehaviour 
and display them at the ticket counter. Secondly, increase the staff member presence in the auditorium.

Your cooperation in this matter is much appreciated. Furthermore, an open line of communication from your side will greatly help out. 

Yours sincerely,
Rahul Sharma
