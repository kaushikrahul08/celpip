# write a email to gym instructor about a unsatisfied result 

Dear Mark,

The purpose of my writing today is to inform you about my extremely unsatisfied result after completing the fitness program at Dream World Gym.

To begin with, I am a premium service member in your Gym. I purchased the sixty-day fitness program in March 2023 from Toronto after reading the newspaper advertisement!
My expectation was very clear to you at the start of the gym classes that I am looking to reduce my weight to avoid my blood pressure dilemma. However, the training and guidelines provided by you were insane and not considerable at all. Moreover, I was promised that I would get a weekly dedicated belly class. In addition to that, the courtesy and professionalism of the staff did not 
align with your gym's reputation.

To resolve these issues and restore my confidence, I kindly request you provide me with a no-cost thirty-day program with your certified fitness instructor. 
Ensuring a seamless and perfect service experience is the topmost priority.

Your cooperation in this matter is greatly appreciated. Furthermore, an open line of communication from your side in this matter greatly helps out.

Sincerely,
Rahul Sharma
