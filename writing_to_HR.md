# writing email to HR for a incident 

Dear HR Department,

The purpose of my writing today is to inform you about a couple of unfortunate incidents which occurred to me in our office premises.
I had to face some racial comments from my colleague John Raven. Initially, I ignored hoping he would stop, however, to my utter astonishment, he kept repeating those abusive words. 
Additionally, I have come to know, two more colleagues faced similar behavior from John. Moreover, they were new employees and they do not want to make an issue.

These episodes mostly occurred during my late-night shift. The recent one was on 5th June 2023, around 11 pm on the ground floor of our production unit. Consequently, I warned him that his behavior is deplorable, 
and I will complain to management about his unwarranted and unprovoked attitude. 

This time around, I decided to record him. I switched on my phone and recorded the whole conversation. Apart from recording, I initiated a signature campaign against John from all those victims who faced similar 
racial comments.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I appreciate your commitment to maintaining a safe and inclusive work environment.

Yours sincerely,
Rahul Sharma
