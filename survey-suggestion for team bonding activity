To whom it may concern,

I have recently become aware that you are looking team suggestions on choosing the best activity between painting and rock climbing for team bond activity during our lunch hours. 
However, I opine that the idea of selecting painting would be an appropriate option.

Conspicuously, since painting allows team members to express their creativity and individuality. Also, it is a relaxing and enjoyable way to connect with colleagues in a non-work setting. Furthermore, it will save our valuable time which we are going to spend in transportation while going outdoor.

Moreover, painting classes are generally inclusive, as they cater to various skill levels. It's an activity that everyone can participate in. 

However, rock climbing activity may not server a valuable purpose as it will give more cost to the company and required lots of individual efforts.

Based on the aforementioned reasoning, I still stand by my stance that the choosing paining would be a top-notch option for team bonding. 

Thank for affording me the chance to share my perspective on this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Aarti Sharma
