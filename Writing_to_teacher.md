Dear Professor Lee,

I hope that you remember me from last year; I took your course in artificial intelligence. I was the lucky one whom you supported in the college scholarships 
with your valuable comments to the director of the university. 

Since engineering went so well. I got the opportunity to attend an interview with one of the organization; renowned experts in the field of 
automation and artificial intelligence. Moreover, the interview was great based on the feedback from the company. Nevertheless, Based on the conversation during 
my interview, they are highly interested in my project which I completed last year with your assistance. 

Therefore, The purpose of my writing today is to get a reference letter from you that can fulfill the needs of the interviewer to proceed 
further with my employment. Also, I would appreciate it if you could mention some of my top-notch qualities like communication and power-shell expertise.

Your kind cooperation in this matter is highly appreciated. However, an open line of communication from your end would greatly help out in this matter.

Yours sincerely,
Rahul Sharma
