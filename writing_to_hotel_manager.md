# A bad experience faced at hotel while having dinner.

Dear Manager,

The purpose of my writing today is to inform you about the inconvenience faced myself in the recent dining experience we had at your esteemed restaurant.

To begin with, being one of the top-notch cuisines in the city, I expected an appetizing meal from the restaurant.
Nonetheless, I was disappointed after seeing the food served at my table; The vegetable curry was cold and lacked freshness. Additionally, whatâ€™s worse, I ordered non-spicy French fries 
for my daughter, but they topped the fries with pepper and chilling powder.

Furthermore, the service we encountered at your restaurant during our visit was below par.  The wait staff was inattentive and overwhelmed. Moreover, the courtesy and 
professionalism of the staff did not alight the reputation of the restaurant.

However, to resolve these issues and therapy the situation, I think you need to hire more staff and provide training for being attentive and customer interaction.

I am looking forward to seeing how my suggestions promptly translate into actions. Furthermore, an open line of communication from your side would be greatly appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Rahul Sharma
