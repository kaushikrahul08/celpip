Hello Ian,

I have recently become aware that our organization is implementing a scent-free policy. Moreover, the idea of implementing this policy at our workplace has sparked recent debate and controversy. However, I opine that the idea of implementing this policy is a more appropriate option.

However, I believe that people should be free to do whatever they wish as long as their actions do not harm others. Conspicuously, various groups of people are hypersensitive to strong perfume fragrances and can often suffer from serious health issues after exposure. For some people, a strong perfume smell can cause dilemmas like migraine headaches and a few people can get temporary blindness. Furthermore, strong odours can trigger or lead to asthmatic attacks.

By allowing workers to wear strong perfume at the workplace, the company would be promoting an environment that compromises the health and safety of the staff who are allergic to these smells.
Based on the aforementioned reasoning, I still stand by my stance that the workplace should have a scent-free policy.

Thank for affording me the chance to share my perspective on this matter.

Best regards,
Rahul Sharma
